Help robots identify the surface they try to walk.

We are provided with already collected Inertial Measurement Units (IMU sensors) data.

The task is to predict which one of the nine floor types (carpet, tiles, concrete) the robot is on using sensor data such as acceleration and velocity.

Submissions are evaluated on Multiclass Accuracy, which is simply the average number of observations with the correct label.
